# Welcome to web-programming

This repo holds personal notes and examples as I learn web development. 

I'll maintain an `index.html` file at the root of this repo which will contain my notes and links to example pages I create as I go along.

Feel free to re-use the code here but beware! The structure of this repo could change without warning.
