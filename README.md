# Welcome to web-programming

This repo holds personal notes and examples as I learn web development. 

I'll maintain a `site` directory which will serve as the root for all web content I create here. I'll also include a `Dockerfile` which will create an nginx web server container that includes all the content inside `site`.

Feel free to re-use the code here but beware! The structure of this repo could change without warning.
